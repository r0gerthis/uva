Python code from the UvA IS HCM program, Multimedia Information Systems course

This is the Python code I created for the lab assignments in the UvA Information Studies/Sciences Human Centered Multimedia (MSc) track for the course Multimedia Information Systems in 2013/2014
This course has been renamed to 'Visual Search Engines' in 2014/2015.

Shared it for whoever is interested :)
